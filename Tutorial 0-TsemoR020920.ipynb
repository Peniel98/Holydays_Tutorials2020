    "Simulating quantum systems is very important in quantum physics because it allows to save up much time. The advantage physicians have is that we already have computers we can use to do those simulations. To help for the implementation of quantum physics, physicians like J.R Johansson and P.Nation set on foot a quantum library written in python called QuTiP (Quantum Toolbox in Python) which quantum physicians can use like a luggage containing kind of *quantum objects* quantum physicians need to work in python platforms. In order to use QuTiP library, there is a very interactive open-source web applicant called Jupyter Notebook that allows to create and share notebook containing code, equations, graphics, text and so on."

    " QuTiP is a very interesting software for simulating quantum systems using quantum elements (ket, bras operators...) as objects. Using QuTiP, we can simulate arbitrary time-evolution quantum systems. Indeed QuTiP is very interesting library in the domain of quantum optics, ion-trap, superconducting systems  .... QuTiP uses many numerical packages that are very important for his functions. We can cite Numpy generally for plotting and easily manipulate arrays , Scipy for scientific algorithms and Matplotlib for plotting graphs. "
